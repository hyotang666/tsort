# TSORT 0.0.0 - Topological sorting the DAG.
## Introduction
### Current lisp world
List is flexible.
We can treat it as DAG (Directed Asyclic Graph).

### Issues
Common Lisp does not have such operators.
Rationale: Topological sorting is interesting algorithm.
It is hard to get consensus about it.

### Proposal
Fortunately, this is not language specification, just library.
Although selfish specification, TSORT provides it.
